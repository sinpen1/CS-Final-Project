Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

The gravity, pipes, collision detection, scoring system, and bird movement are all operational.  We are currently refining the images, adding sound effects, and a high score option.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

Sound effects, background music, and the high score storage mechanism are still not included.  Additionally, we're still checking for issues and refining the images.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Accurately detecting collisions between the pipes and the bird was one problem we encountered.  Timing the pipe spawning and ensuring that the game loop operates without lag were other issues we encountered.
