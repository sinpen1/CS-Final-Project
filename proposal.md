# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Flappy Bird: Remix

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Python side-scrolling game that replicates the original Flappy Bird gameplay using Pygame.  To score points, the player controls a bird that has to fly across pipes without colliding with them.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My project utilizes Pygame and Python to create a basic game of Flappy Bird.  The player controls a bird throughout the game that falls due to gravity.  The bird will flap and will ascend when you click on the space bar.  Traveling across spaces between pipes without colliding into them is the goal.  Your scores are incremented whenever you pass a pipe.

There will be a start screen and a game-over screen, and there will be sound effects when the bird hits a pipe or flaps.  I'll also have a score counter to make the game more interesting and place the pipes in different locations. Pygame will be used to handle the functionality of the game and draw the graphics, and everything will be done in Python.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

1. A simple game with common Flappy Bird features
2. Using flap control and gravity to get the bird airborne
3. Pipes with collision detection randomly placed
4. Score tracking
5. The initial and game over screens

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. Everything from the GOOD outcome  
2. Sound effects (collision, flap, etc.) and background music
3. Tracking high scores which are saved even if the game is closed
4. Smoother motions and smoother graphics
5. Capability to continue playing the game without quitting

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

1. Everything from the BETTER outcome
2. A variety of alternatives for characters or birds
3. Various background themes (sky/city, day/night, etc.)
4. As the score rises, the challenge increases (pipes travel faster or gaps get smaller).
5. Options on the main menu (character choose, volume, etc.)
6. The ability to pause and resume operations

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will have to go back and structure some of the basic game code that we frantically cobbled together initially in an attempt to finish our Flappy Bird project. Basic pipe generation and bird movement are already functional, but we omitted several planning steps and now need to actually structure our code and contend with game states like the start screen and game-over screen. Including sound effects, background music, and a high score system that saves from session to session are some of the things we would like to investigate. Pygame's handling of sound and file storage will be addressed in more detail. My project partner and I would like to split up the remaining work because I am working with another classmate. One of us will work more on debugging and polishing the code, while the other will work on the final layout and graphics, including animations.  In order to meet the deadline, we would like to take our rough build and make it a finished, enjoyable game.
